# cgp-github-test
A test to see if my [Golang Docker project generator functions properly](https://github.com/QRX53/DockerGoTemplateScript/tree/main)

If a green checkmark appears next to the latest commit, it means the project can be compiled successfuly on GitHub's end. 
This will be tested once per day forever.
